## Introduction

Introduce graphs, relate them back to trees (a familiar data structure), and their significance/use cases in theoretical computer science and real-world applications.

## Implementation

Talk about the most popular implementations of graphs: adjancency lists, adjacency matrices, and edge lists. Discuss the pros and cons of each.

## Traversals

Discuss the most common graph traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Explain how they work, their time and space complexity, and their use cases.

## Conclusion
