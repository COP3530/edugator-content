## Introduction

Graphs are a fundamental data structure in computer science with a wide range of theoretical and practical applications. In fact, we've already seen a few examples of graphs in previous lessons. For example, trees â€” acyclic undirected graphs (we'll get into what that means in the next section).

### Definition

A **graph** $`G`$ is a set of vertices (also called nodes) $`V`$ and a set of unordered pairs called edges $`E`$.

In the above example, the vertices are $`V = \{a, b, c, d, e\}`$ and the edges are $`E = \{\{a, b\}, \{b, c\}, \{c, d\}, \{d, e\}\}`$. Note that the edges are unordered pairs, meaning that the edge $`\{a, b\}`$ is the same as the edge $`\{b, a\}`$.

Consider the tree below:

The set of vertices and edges are:

- $`V = \{a, b, c, d, e, f, g\}, E = \{\{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{d, c\}\}`$
- $`V = \{a, b, c, d\}, E = \{\{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{d, c\}, \{b, c\}\}`$
- $`V = \{a, b, c, d\}, E = \{\{a, b\}, \{c, b\}, \{c, d\}\}`$
- $`V = \{a, b, c, d\}, E = \{\{a, b\}, \{b, c\}\}`$

## Terminology

## Implementation

Talk about the most popular implementations of graphs: adjancency lists, adjacency matrices, and edge lists. Discuss the pros and cons of each.

## Traversals

Discuss the most common graph traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Explain how they work, their time and space complexity, and their use cases.
