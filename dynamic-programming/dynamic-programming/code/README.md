# Dynamic Programming

To run a program such as `fibonacci.cpp`, run the command via `Make`

```bash
Make fibonacci
```

This will compile and write the binary to `bin/fibonacci` where you can run it.
If you do not have `Make` installed, you can run the commands issued by `Make` directly in this directory.
